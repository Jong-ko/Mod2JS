`Hello this is my readme file.
I think the hardest part so far is git and github. as i was doing this i realized how much i like to move files around and 
reorganize them but that ends up breaking a lot of repos and i have to be careful. im not 100% used to it so i end up having to 
remake anything.

I also feel that outside of the reading we have mostly covered the topics on the how to do things but not the why. Some more 
depth into that would make us more hireable as being able to communicat with colleague about the work is an important skill.

I understand that as a parttime cohort we dont have much time to go over everything so we must take it upon ourselves to learn. 

other then that great job! Im excited to see whats in store in the next upcoming months.'
